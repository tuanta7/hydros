Built with inspiration from Ory Hydra & Kratos. Hydr/os is a Go-based OIDC provider implementing modern OAuth2.1 flows for services that need robust identity and access management without the bloat. 

Hydros provides a focused implementation of OAuth2.1 grant types designed for simplicity, auditability, and integration into existing systems. Ideal for microservices, APIs, and internal platforms that require secure authentication and token management.

## Key Features

    - Authorization Code Grant with PKCE
    - Client Credentials Grant
    - Refresh Token Grant
- Built-in Go for performance and easy deployment
- Pluggable persistence using SQL backends
- Minimal, auditable codebase that’s easy to extend
